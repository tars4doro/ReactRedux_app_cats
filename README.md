Small and quickly made <React/Create React App/Redux/Redux-Thunk/Tachyons> project with instant search and randomly generated cat avatars API for demo purposes.

deployed to Heroku at https://react-redux-cats-static-build.herokuapp.com/

P.S. this is a remake of my puroReact_app_cats using Redux (gitHub: https://github.com/tars4doro/puroReact_app_cats  Heroku: https://puro-react-cats-static-build.herokuapp.com/)
